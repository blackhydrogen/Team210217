## Server setup.
You will need to install Node.js v5.7.0 or higher (https://nodejs.org/en/) and Postgres SQL; for Postgres SQL, follow instructions.md in the `/database_setup` folder.

## Run server.
After setup, start command prompt/shell.

1. Change into this directory (where this README.md is).
2. If this is your first time running, run `npm install` first.
3. Then enter `node .` to run the server. (If you are using Mac/Linux, `sudo node .` will be needed.) It will listen on port 80 (default). So you can use `http://localhost` in your web browser to view the web app.
4. If running `node .` gives you some package-not-found error, try step 2 again first.
